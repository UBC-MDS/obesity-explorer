# Reflection Document - Milestone2

- Authors: Dustin Burnham, Javairia Raza, Rafael Pilliard Hellwig, Tanmay Sharma

The group has been able to deploy an interactive app built using dash as envisioned in the proposal document from Milestone1. Currently, our app is able to provide some trends and associations related to obesity. We have included a timeline on how obesity trends have increased over time, a map on how rates differ by country as well as their rankings on a bar plot and also provided a scatterplot that compares different variables against obesity to generalize associations and look at different groupings such as sex, region, etc. For future improvements, we are hoping to build a system where the default selection includes all the data. Other limitations we wish to improve upon are updating the interactivity between charts, more user friendly navigation instructions, improving readability of our axes and legends, updating the size/aspect ratios, adding tabs to avoid clutter and updating the CSS aesthetics. 

In terms of what our dashboard does well, the team feels satisfied with the professional look of the tool, and the fact that it provides a bird’s eye view of unique trends surrounding obesity. As we designed it for a persona of a grad student doing public health research, we find that it reasonably achieves that goal by quickly identifying factors associated with obesity. Users can also narrow-in on countries and sub-populations of specific interest. Although we had initial concerns that the volume of information and controls might overwhelm the user, we find that the current prototype actually does a good job at synthesizing the data into a digestible, coherent story. 

## Known bugs at this stage of development:
Fix missing data issue (map and scatter plot)
Map tooltip stopped working
Addressing missing countries (South Sudan and Cote d’Ivoire)
If there is an empty selection, everything should be shown by default

## Future Improvements and Additions:
Improve interactivity between existing plots using Altair
Add tabs to decrease clutter
Add country selection to the bar plot
Add trend lines to the factor plot
Move year slider below time series plot
Improve plot legends/axis for readability
Single year vertical line for selected year
Add the radio button to show top or bottom countries for bar plot
Add a tab with a table of aggregated data
Give the time series plot a start and end points
Continue improving the CSS design aesthetics
Change default zoom of map to remove white padding
